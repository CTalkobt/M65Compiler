# Changelog

All notable changes to the cc45 / ca45 suite will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- **Compiler (cc45)**:
    - **Relocatable stack base (`__sp_base`)**: Replaced all hardcoded `$0101` references in `M65Emitter` and `AssemblerSimulatedOps` with the configurable `__sp_base` symbol (default `$0101`). Predefined in both `ca45` and `cc45`; overridable via `-D__sp_base=$NNNN`. In relocatable mode (`-c`), `__sp_base` can be declared `.extern` for linker resolution, with `R_WORD` relocations generated at all stack-access sites. Also fixed a pre-existing bug in `ptrstack` where the high byte was hardcoded to 0 instead of the stack page.
    - **`#pragma crt no_0100_stack`**: Emits `.extern __sp_base` in relocatable mode so the linker can resolve the stack base address for non-page-$01 stacks.
    - **`#pragma crt exit_rts|exit_halt|exit_brk`**: Select program exit behavior after `main` returns. `exit_rts` (default): saves/restores the caller's full 16-bit SP using self-modifying code (SP values stored in the immediate operands of the restore instructions — zero extra bytes). Provides `__exit` label for `exit()`. `exit_halt`: infinite `bra` loop. `exit_brk`: single BRK instruction. Setting one unsets the others.
    - **`#pragma crt no_bssinit`**: Controls BSS zeroing at startup. Default behavior emits `_init_bss` which zeros the BSS segment via a 16-bit pointer loop (`__bss_start` to `__bss_end`). Pragma suppresses the zeroing, emitting only an `rts` stub. Init sequence: `_init_bss` → `_init_features` → `_main`.
    - **Frame pointer removal**: Eliminated the 5-byte `proc` prologue (`TSX; LDA #page; PHA; PHX`) and 2-byte `endproc` epilogue (`PLA; PLA`). Parameters now use direct stack-relative addressing (`TSX; LDA __sp_base+offset,X`) — same as locals — instead of indirect `($nn,SP),Y` via a saved frame pointer. Params are added to `currentVars` and bumped by `.var` alongside locals. `_fp` starts at 0 (was 1). Saves 7 bytes code + 2 bytes stack per function call.
- **Standard Library (stdlib45.lib)**:
    - **`stdlib.h` / `exit()`**: `_Noreturn void exit(int status)` — loads status into `.AX` and jumps to `__exit` (CRT-provided). Works with all exit modes.
    - **`string.h`** — 12 hand-written 45GS02 assembly functions: `strlen`, `strcpy`, `strncpy`, `strcmp`, `strncmp`, `strcat`, `strchr`, `strrchr`, `memcpy`, `memmove`, `memset`, `memcmp`. All use the frame-pointer-free convention (`.var _fp = 0`).
    - **`ctype.h`** — 7 PETSCII-aware character functions in hand-written 45GS02 assembly: `isdigit`, `isalpha`, `isalnum`, `isspace`, `isprint`, `toupper`, `tolower`. All use inline range checks (no lookup table). `toupper`/`tolower` convert between PETSCII lowercase (`$41`–`$5A`) and uppercase (`$C1`–`$DA`) via bit manipulation.
    - Updated existing stdlib modules (`putchar`, `puts`, `strlen`, `memset`) to the new frame-pointer-free convention.
- **Testing**:
    - Added `test_bssinit.c` — mmemu validation test for BSS zeroing. Pre-fills RAM with `$DE` garbage, verifies uninitialized globals start at zero and assigned values are correct.
    - Added `test_strlen.c` — validates `strlen` with 4 cases (empty, 1-char, 5-char, 10-char).
    - Added `test_strcmp.c` — validates `strcmp` with 6 cases (equal, empty, less-than, greater-than, prefix).
    - Added `test_strcpy.c` — validates `strcpy` with `strcmp`/`strlen` verification.
    - Added `test_memcpy.c` — validates `memset`, `memcpy`, `memcmp` with 6 cases.
    - Added `test_strchr.c` — validates `strchr`/`strrchr` with 5 cases (first, last, not-found).

### Optimized
- **Compiler (cc45)**:
    - **Granular Store Optimization**: The compiler now individually tracks the `A` and `X` registers during 16-bit assignments. If either register already contains the correct byte for the target variable, the corresponding `sta` or `stx` instruction is omitted. Standalone 8-bit stores are similarly optimized.
    - **Self-Assignment Elimination**: Standalone `x = x;` statements for non-volatile variables are now completely optimized out.
    - **Improved Register Reuse**: Removed aggressive register tracker invalidation after local variable declarations, allowing registers initialized during variable setup to be reused by subsequent statements.

### Fixed
- **Compiler (cc45)**:
    - **Volatile Correctness**: Fixed a bug where `volatile` variable loads were being optimized away by the register tracker. Volatile variables now strictly result in explicit memory reads and writes as required by the C standard.
    - **Stack-relative LDX/LDA suffix**: Ensured that granular 16-bit loads for local variables correctly use the `, s` stack-relative suffix.

### Changed
- **Assembler (ca45)**:
    - `proc` now emits 0 bytes (was 5). No prologue — it only establishes scope and creates parameter symbols.
    - `endproc` emits only `RTS`/`RTS #n` (was `PLA; PLA; RTS`/`RTS #n`). Size: 1-2 bytes (was 3-4).
    - Parameter symbols created by `proc` are no longer `isFrameRelative`. Offsets start at 2 (past return address) instead of frame-relative Y offset 3.
    - `__sp_base` added as a predefined symbol (`$0101`) in both `ca45` and `cc45`.
    - All simulated stack ops (`lda.sp`, `sta.sp`, `inw.sp`, `dew.sp`, `phw.sp`, `ptrstack`, `neg.16`/`not.16`/`abs.16` on stack, DMA `fill.sp`/`move.sp`) use `M65Emitter::spBase()` instead of hardcoded `$0101`.

## [0.99.dev] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- **Suite-wide**:
    - **`-V` / `--version` flag** on all tools (`cc45`, `ca45`, `ln45`, `ar45`, `nm45`, `objdump45`). Prints `toolname v0.99.dev (githash)` where the git hash is embedded at compile time.
    - `include/Version.hpp` centralizes the version string; Makefile passes `-DGIT_HASH` automatically.
- **Linker (ln45)**:
    - **`-M <file>` — Linker map file**: Writes a detailed map file after linking, showing merged segment layout (address ranges and sizes), per-object segment contributions (which file contributes which address range), and all resolved symbols sorted by address with source file and weak/strong annotations.
- **Utilities**:
    - **`objdump45` — Object File Inspector & Disassembler**: Displays file headers (`-f`), section headers (`-h`), symbol tables (`-t`), relocation entries (`-r`), hex dumps (`-s`), and full 45GS02 disassembly (`-d`) from `.o45` and `.o65` object files. Also supports `.prg` files (auto-detects 2-byte load address) and raw `.bin` files (with `-b ADDR` for base address). Disassembly features symbolic labels at export addresses, branch/call target annotations with symbol names, and support for all 45GS02 addressing modes including `($nn,SP),Y`, `[zp],Z`, 16-bit branches, `PHW #imm16`, and `RTS #n`. Flags can be combined (`-fdt`); `-a` shows all. Built from a reverse lookup of the assembler's opcode database.
- **Testing**:
    - Added `test_objdump45.sh` — 113 assertions validating all `objdump45` display modes: version/help output, error handling (missing files, bad format, no flags), file header fields, section headers, symbol table (imports, exports, weak symbols, type letters), relocation entries, hex dump contents, disassembly (mnemonics, operand formatting, all addressing modes), branch target annotations, symbol labels, combined flags, multi-file output, PRG disassembly (auto-detected load address, `-b` override, hex dump), raw `.bin` disassembly (with `-b` base address, default base), and BASIC upstart PRG handling. Integrated into `make test` and available standalone via `make test-objdump45`.
- **Assembler (ca45)**:
    - **`mul.s16` / `div.s16`** — Signed 16-bit multiply and divide. Wraps the MEGA65 hardware math unit ($D770+/$D760+) with automatic sign correction: saves sign XOR, takes absolute values, performs unsigned operation, negates result if needed. Uses $D76E as sign scratch byte.
    - **`mod.16`** — Unsigned 16-bit modulo. Performs `div.16` then reads the hardware remainder registers ($D770/$D771).
    - **`mod.s16`** — Signed 16-bit modulo. Sign of result follows the dividend (C99 semantics).
- **Testing**:
    - Promoted 19 tests to the mmemu execution-validation suite: `test_ptr_arith`, `test_ptr_ptr`, `test_complex_math`, `test_struct`, `test_opt_struct`, `test_large_struct`, `test_anon_struct`, `test_union`, `test_global_vars`, `test_global_res`, `test_switch_continue`, `test_goto_sizeof`, `test_signed_cc`, `test_sub`, `test_struct_param`, `test_typedef`, `test_generic`, `test_strength_reduction`, `test_volatile`. Total mmemu-validated tests: 47 (up from 28).
    - Added `test_ptr_precedence.c` — validates pointer operator precedence and indirect increment/decrement: `(*p)++`, `++*p`, `(*p)--`, `--*p`, `*p++`, `arr[i]++`, and `char*` variants (14 test cases, mmemu-validated).

### Fixed
- **Compiler (cc45)**:
    - **Indirect increment/decrement**: `++`/`--` on dereferenced pointers (`(*p)++`, `++*p`), array elements (`arr[i]++`), and arrow-accessed members (`p->field++`) now correctly emit load-modify-store sequences through the pointer. Previously, the CodeGenerator's fallback path for non-variable lvalue operands evaluated the expression but discarded the increment/decrement, producing no side effect.
    - **Signed right-shift**: `>>` on signed types now emits `asr.16` (arithmetic shift right, preserving sign bit) instead of `lsr.16` (logical shift right). Affects four code paths: constant-count shifts, dynamic-count shifts in `emitOperation()`, and dynamic-count shifts in `BinaryOperation` visitor.
    - **Signed multiply/divide/modulo**: The compiler now emits `mul.s16`, `div.s16`, `mod.s16` for signed operands and `mod.16` for unsigned modulo (replacing direct `$D770`/`$D771` hardware register reads). Applies in `emitOperation()`, constant-literal paths, and general `BinaryOperation` visitor.
    - **Power-of-2 division optimization**: The shift-right optimization (`/ 4` → `lsr.16` × 2) is now skipped for signed types, which require proper truncation-toward-zero semantics. Signed divisions fall through to `div.s16`.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- **Compiler (cc45)**:
    - **Relocatable object mode (`-c`)**: `cc45 -c input.c -o output.o45` compiles C to a `.o45` relocatable object file. The CodeGenerator auto-emits `.global` for defined functions and global variables, `.extern` for called-but-not-defined functions. Skips the `.org $2000` and startup stub in reloc mode. The `-o` flag controls the final `.o45` name; intermediate `.s` file is generated automatically.
    - **`#pragma weak`**: Marks the next function or global variable as a weak export. The preprocessor converts `#pragma weak` to an internal `.weak_next` marker; the CodeGenerator emits `.weak` instead of `.global`. Weak symbols can be overridden by strong definitions at link time.
    - **Frame-pointer-relative parameter access**: Function parameters are now accessed via a saved frame pointer using the 45GS02's native `($nn,SP),Y` addressing mode (opcodes $E2/$82). The `proc` prologue saves SP as a 16-bit LE pointer on the stack (`TSX; LDA #$01; PHA; PHX`). Parameters get fixed Y offsets that never change as locals are pushed, eliminating the need for `.var` offset bumping on parameters.
    - Added `_fp` assembler variable that tracks the frame pointer's stack position, automatically adjusted by `.var` as locals are declared.
    - Added `test_many_params_locals.c` — validates functions with >2 parameters (up to 5) and >2 local variables (up to 6), including mixed char/int params, nested multi-param calls, and computed expression arguments (10 test cases).
    - Added `test_16bit_stack.s` — validates 16-bit stack pointer relocation via `TYS`/`TSY` with push/pull verification on page $40.
- **Assembler (ca45)**:
    - Added `BASE_PAGE_INDIRECT_SP_Y` to `emitInstruction` (text and binary modes) and `calculateInstructionSize` — the `($nn,SP),Y` addressing mode was previously missing from the instruction encoder.
    - Added `lda_frame`/`sta_frame` methods to `M65Emitter` for frame-pointer-relative memory access.
    - Added `FrameAccessInfo` / `resolveFrameAccess()` helper to `AssemblerParser` for detecting frame-relative symbols.
    - **Relocatable object mode (`-c`)**: New `-c` flag produces `.o45` relocatable object files instead of flat binaries. Extracts per-segment bodies, generates `R_WORD` relocation entries for external and cross-segment references, builds import/export symbol tables from `.global`/`.extern` directives. Default output filename is `out.o45`.
    - **`.global` directive**: Marks symbols for export in `.o45` output.
    - **`.extern` directive**: Declares imported symbols (resolved by linker). Creates placeholder symbols with value 0 and assigns zero-based import indices for relocation entries.
    - **`.weak` directive**: Marks symbols as weak exports. Weak symbols use the high bit of the export segment byte (`O45_EXPORT_WEAK = 0x80`). The linker resolves strong-over-weak: two strong = error, strong+weak = strong wins, weak+weak = first wins.
- **Linker infrastructure (`.o45` format)**:
    - `O45Types.hpp` — format constants, enums (`O45Segment`, `O45RelocType`), mode bits, CPU IDs, and helper functions.
    - `O45Writer` — produces complete `.o45` files (header, options, segment bodies, relocation tables, symbol tables).
    - `O45RelocEncoder` — encodes high-level relocation entries into `.o65`/`.o45` delta-offset byte streams.
    - `O45SymbolTable` — manages imports/exports with deduplication, validation, and `applyTo(writer)`.
    - `O45Emitter` — bridge between the assembler and `.o45` format: extracts segments, scans for relocations, packages output.
    - `O45Reader` — parses `.o45` and `.o65` files back into structured data (header, options, segments, relocations, symbol tables). Supports both 16-bit and 32-bit formats.
    - `O45Linker` — links multiple `.o45` objects: segment merging, symbol resolution (with duplicate/undefined detection), relocation decoding and patching (all types: WORD, LOW, HIGH, LINEAR24, LINEAR32, SEGADR), flat binary or PRG output.
    - `O45RelocDecoder` — decodes delta-offset relocation byte streams back into high-level `O45Reloc` entries (inverse of `O45RelocEncoder`).
- **Utilities**:
    - **`ln45` — Linker**: Links multiple `.o45` relocatable objects into a flat binary or PRG. Merges text/data/bss/zp segments, resolves imports against exports, applies relocations. Supports library archives (`.lib`) with selective linking — only members needed to resolve undefined symbols are pulled in, with iterative chain resolution. Flags: `-t`/`-d`/`-b`/`-z` (segment base addresses), `-prg` (PRG output with load header), `-basic` (PRG with BASIC `SYS` stub at `$0801` for auto-run on MEGA65/C64), `-l` (link against library), `-m` (print symbol map).
    - **`ar45` — Archiver**: Creates and manages `.lib` archive files containing `.o45` object members. Commands: `c` (create), `t` (list), `x` (extract), `s` (symbol index), `a` (add members), `d` (delete members). Automatically builds a global symbol index by scanning each member's exports.
    - **`nm45` — Symbol Lister**: Lists exported/imported symbols in `.o45` and `.o65` object files. Traditional `nm` output format: `offset type name` (U=undefined, T=text, D=data, B=bss, Z=zp). Flags: `-u` (undefined only), `-g` (exported only), `-n` (sort by address), `-r` (reverse sort), `-p` (no sort), `-A`/`-o` (prepend filename for grep-friendly output). Multi-file listing.
- **Testing**:
    - Added `test_many_params_locals` to both `test_compiler.sh` and `test_mmemu.sh` validation suites.
    - Added 16-bit stack pointer test to `test_mmemu.sh` — verifies TYS/TSY and push/pull on a relocated stack page.
    - Added `test_global_extern.s` to assembler test suite — validates `.global`/`.extern` directive parsing.
    - Added `test_o45` unit test binary (217 assertions) — validates `.o45` header, segment bodies, relocation encoding, symbol tables, option headers, and segment mapping.

### Changed
- **Compiler (cc45)**:
    - **Symbol naming convention (C linkage)**: Global variables changed from `_g_` prefix to `_` (single underscore). Functions changed from bare names to `_` prefix (e.g., `main` -> `_main`). This follows the traditional C linkage convention for cross-toolchain compatibility (cc65, etc.). Parameters (`_p_`) and locals (`_l_`) are unchanged. The `isGlobal` detection now uses `globalVariableTypes.count(rName)` instead of prefix matching.
    - Parameters (`_p_` variables) are no longer added to `currentVars` and no longer receive `.var` offset bumps when locals are declared.
    - Return cleanup now pops 2 additional bytes for the saved frame pointer.
- **Assembler (ca45)**:
    - `proc` now emits 5 bytes of frame pointer save code (previously 0).
    - `endproc` emits 2 PLA instructions for frame pointer cleanup before RTS.
    - Size adjustment pass updated to use new `proc` (5 bytes) and `endproc` (3-4 bytes) sizes.
    - All simulated stack-access opcodes (`lda.sp`, `sta.sp`, `ldax`, `stax`, `phw.sp`, `ptrstack`, stack inc/dec, `neg.16`/`not.16`/`abs.16` on stack) now check for frame-relative symbols and use `($nn,SP),Y` addressing when appropriate.
    - `VariableNode::emit` in expression evaluator updated for frame-relative variables.
    - `pass2()` now updates segment `pc` fields at the end of each iteration, making segment sizes available to the `.o45` emitter after assembly.

### Fixed
- **Compiler (cc45)**:
    - **Explicit cast expressions**: Support for C-style cast syntax `(type)expr` including `int`, `char`, `void`, `struct`, `union`, `enum`, `signed`/`unsigned`, typedef aliases, and pointer casts. Casts are parsed in `parseUnary()` at the correct precedence level, with constant folding support (e.g., `(char)0x1FF` folds to `0xFF` at compile time).
    - **Implicit narrowing warnings**: The compiler now emits warnings to stderr when implicit conversions lose data — e.g., assigning an `int` to a `char` variable, or a pointer to a `char`. Explicit casts suppress the warning. Warnings also detect constant overflow (e.g., assigning `500` to a `char`).
    - Added `test_struct_param.c` — validates struct pointer parameters with the arrow operator (`p->member`), including nested structs.
    - Added `test_inline_asm.c` — validates inline assembly (`__asm__()`) accessing parameters (`_p_`), locals (`_l_`), and globals (`_`) with mmemu emulator validation.
- **Testing**:
    - Added `test_cast.c` — validates explicit cast expressions: int-to-char narrowing, char-to-int widening, literal casts, nested casts, pointer-to-int casts, and casts in arithmetic expressions (10 test cases).
    - Added `test_narrowing_warn.c` — validates implicit narrowing warning output: 3 expected warnings (int-to-char declaration, int-to-char assignment, pointer-to-char) and 4 expected non-warnings (explicit cast, widening, same-size).
    - Added `test_inline_asm` to `test_mmemu.sh` — validates inline asm variable access (int params, char params, global stores, local read/write) via memory inspection at `$4000`.

### Fixed
- **Compiler (cc45)**:
    - **Arrow operator on struct pointer parameters**: `getExprType()` now checks `_p_` (parameter) prefix before `_l_` (local) in `variableTypes`, matching `resolveVarName()` lookup order. Previously, struct pointer parameters resolved to `int` instead of their declared struct type.
    - **`proc` instruction missing parameter declarations**: Merged parameter declarations (`W#`/`B#`) onto the `proc` instruction line so the assembler creates parameter symbols with correct stack offsets. Previously, parameters were only listed on the no-op `.proc` directive, leaving symbols undefined (offset 0) for functions without local variables.
- **Assembler (ca45)**:
    - **`lda.sp` / `sta.sp` pass-2 code generation**: Added missing `LDA_STACK` and `STA_STACK` dispatch entries in `AssemblerGenerator.cpp`. These simulated opcodes were correctly sized in pass 1 but emitted zero bytes (BRK) during code generation.
    - **`.var` assignment double-evaluation**: Removed the `.var` ASSIGN re-evaluation from the pass-2 generator. Self-referencing expressions like `.var _p_val = _p_val + 2` were evaluated both during parsing and generation, applying the adjustment twice. The parse-time value is now final.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- **Compiler (cc45)**:
    - Added `-O0` flag to disable all optimizations (constant folding, propagation, dead variable elimination).
    - Added startup code generation: `jsr main; _halt: bra _halt` when a `main` function is present.
    - Added callee local variable cleanup before function return.
    - Added caller argument cleanup after function calls.
    - Added dead store elimination to ConstantFolder — consecutive constant stores to the same variable are collapsed to the final value.
- **Assembler (ca45)**:
    - Added `RTN` to the instruction lexer (previously silently skipped).
    - Added error reporting for unknown instructions during assembly, with output suppression on errors.
    - Added try/catch around instruction parsing to convert parse failures into error messages.
    - Added `*` (current PC) support in expressions (e.g., `bra *+4`, `lda *-2`).
    - Added `TSY` and `TYS` methods to M65Emitter.
    - Added `lda.sp` / `sta.sp` simulated opcodes for 8-bit stack-relative access (expands to `TSX; LDA/STA $0101+offset,X`).
    - Added `phw.sp` simulated opcode for pushing a 16-bit stack-relative variable onto the stack.
    - Added width-suffixed `mul.8`/`.16`/`.24`/`.32` and `div.8`/`.16`/`.24`/`.32` to the instruction lexer.
- **Testing**:
    - Added comprehensive control flow test (`test_mmemu_control.c`) covering if/else, while, do-while, for with break/continue, switch with fallthrough, and ternary operators.
    - Added simple compiler test (`mmemu_compiler_simple.c`).
    - Added `src/test/test_mmemu.sh` and `src/test-resources/test_mmemu_hello.s` for automated validation using `mmemu-cli`.

### Fixed
- **Assembler (ca45)**:
    - **Opcode database**: Corrected `STA` ($82) and `LDA` ($E2) stack-relative entries from `STACK_RELATIVE` (direct) to `BASE_PAGE_INDIRECT_SP_Y` (indirect, matching actual 45GS02 hardware). Removed duplicate `STACK_RELATIVE` entries that shadowed `BASE_PAGE_INDIRECT_Z` opcodes.
    - **Stack access synthesis**: Rewrote `lda_stack`/`sta_stack`/`stz_stack` to use `TSX` + absolute,X indexed addressing (e.g., `TSX; STA $0103,X`) since the 45GS02 has no native direct stack-relative mode. Previous opcodes ($82/$E2) are indirect and were treated as NOPs by the emulator.
    - **Simulated op immediate detection**: Fixed `add.16`, `cmp.16`, `cmp.s16`, `and.16`/`ora.16`/`eor.16`, and `ldw` to correctly distinguish `#immediate` operands from memory address operands. Previously, bare numeric operands like `$02` were incorrectly treated as immediates via `isConstant()`.
    - **CMP16/CMP_S16 expression parsing**: Fixed `#` token not being skipped before expression parsing, causing null AST and zero-length instruction emission.
    - **BRA text output**: Fixed relative branch offset in TEXT mode — the emitter now correctly converts branch offsets to target addresses (adding instruction size) for `*+N` syntax.
    - **Branch target evaluation**: Changed branch target resolution in the generator from `resolveSymbol` (string lookup) to `evaluateExpressionAt` (full expression evaluation), enabling `*+N` and computed targets.
    - **Segment PC tracking**: Fixed pass2 segment PC initialization to use sentinel values, preventing data segment labels from resolving to address $0000.
    - **STAX/LDAX stack simulated ops**: Replaced `PHA`/`PLA` sequences (which shift SP and corrupt TSX-based offsets) with ZP $00 temp storage for preserving register values during multi-byte stack access.
- **Compiler (cc45)**:
    - **ZP temp clobber across function calls**: Reordered evaluation in simple and compound assignment paths to evaluate the RHS first and push to the hardware stack before computing the destination address into ZP. Prevents callee functions from clobbering ZP temporaries.
    - **Dead variable elimination removing live variables**: Fixed `VariableUseChecker` to count assignment targets as uses, preventing variable declarations from being eliminated while dead stores still reference them.
    - **Global struct member access with `, s` suffix**: Fixed MemberAccess visitor that unconditionally appended stack-relative suffix to global variable member loads.
    - **8-bit local variable access**: Changed CodeGenerator to emit `lda.sp`/`sta.sp` simulated opcodes for char-sized local variable access instead of bare `lda`/`sta` with `, s` (which the 45GS02 doesn't support as a native addressing mode).
    - **Function argument passing**: Changed CodeGenerator to emit `phw.sp` instead of `phw.s` for pushing stack-relative variables as function arguments.
    - **ConstantFolder switch cases**: Clear `knownConstants` at each `case`/`default` label to prevent cross-case constant propagation (e.g., `result=20` from case 2 leaking into case 3's `result+5`).
    - **ConstantFolder switch exit**: Clear `knownConstants` after switch body to prevent stale pre-switch values from propagating.
    - **Register cache after stw**: Invalidate register cache after `stw` to global variables (the simulated op clobbers A with the high byte).
    - **emitAddress resultNeeded**: Set `resultNeeded=true` before visiting array base expression in `emitAddress`, preventing stale register values from being used for pointer-indexed accesses.
    - **Local variable stack offset**: Changed `.var` offset for new local variables from `size` to `0` (correct for `$0101+offset` convention where SP+1 = top of stack).

## [Unreleased] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **Compiler (cc45)**:
    - Added support for **Compound Assignment Operators**: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `&=`, `|=`, `^=`, `<<=`, `>>=`.
    - Added support for the **Modulo Operator** (`%`) for integer remainder.
    - Added support for **`for` loop declarations**: variables can now be declared in the initializer clause (e.g., `for (int i = 0; ...)`).
    - Implemented the **`typedef` keyword** for creating type aliases, including support for pointer and struct/union typedefs.
    - Added support for **`enum` types** and enumerator constants.
- **Assembler (ca45)**:
    - Added support for generating **`.prg` files**: If the output filename ends in `.prg`, a 2-byte load address header (inferred from the first `.org`) is prepended to the binary.
    - Improved **`.basicUpstart` directive**:
        - Automatically defaults to `.org $2001` if no start address is specified.
        - Fixed size at 12 bytes across all passes for more reliable label resolution.

### Fixed
- **Compiler (cc45)**:
    - Fixed a critical bug in `BinaryOperation` where operands were being reversed for non-commutative operators (subtraction, division, shifts).
    - Improved constant folding to be more robust across control flow (clearing constants when entering loops).
- **Assembler (ca45)**:
    - Standardized `.basicUpstart` size to 12 bytes to match the emitted code.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Compiler (cc45)**:
    - Added support for the `volatile` keyword for variable declarations and function parameters. `volatile` variables are now explicitly prevented from being optimized away by dead store elimination.
    - Added `-E` flag to run only the preprocessor and output to `stdout` or a file specified by `-o`.
    - Improved multi-call support: if the binary is invoked as `cp45`, it automatically runs in preprocessing-only mode.

- **Documentation**:
    - Renamed preprocessor documentation to `doc/cp45.md` to align with toolchain naming conventions.
- **Assembler (ca45)**:
    - Implemented a suite of high-level simulated opcodes:
        - `ldax / lday / ldaz`: 16-bit word loads with support for immediate (`#`), stack-relative (`offset, s`), zero page, and absolute addressing.
        - `stax / stay / staz`: 16-bit word stores with support for stack-relative, zero page, and absolute addressing.
        - `phw`: 16-bit word push, now supports stack-relative `offset, s` using an optimized `tsx` sequence.
        - `add.16 / sub.16`: 16-bit addition/subtraction on the `.ax` register pair.
        - `and.16 / ora.16 / eor.16`: 16-bit bitwise logic on the `.ax` register pair.
        - `neg.16 / not.16`: 16-bit negation and bitwise NOT, now supports `.ax`, stack-relative, and memory operands.
        - `cpw`: 16-bit word comparison on the `.ax` register pair.
        - `branch.16`: High-level 16-bit zero-check branching (`beq`, `bne`).
        - `chkzero.8 / .16`: Truthiness check returning a boolean in `.a`.
        - `ptrstack`: Efficiently calculates and loads a stack variable address into `.ax`.
        - `ptrderef`: De-references a 16-bit pointer stored in Zero Page.
        - `ldw.f / stw.f / inc.f / dec.f`: Linear 28-bit memory access (using hardware `eom` prefixes).
        - `swap / zero`: Multi-register manipulation helpers.
    - Added `@` prefix for "don't care" labels to define local optimization windows.

### Changed
- **Compiler (cc45)**:
    - Updated all code generation to utilize the new simulated opcodes, resulting in significantly more compact assembly.
    - Implemented **Parameter Prefixing**: All function parameters are now prefixed with `_p_` to avoid collisions with CPU registers or flags.
    - Implemented **Local Variable Prefixing**: All local variables are now prefixed with `_l_`.
    - *Note*: Global variables were initially prefixed with `_g_`; later changed to `_` (single underscore, traditional C linkage convention).
    - Integrated `ldax #value` for more efficient 16-bit constant and string address loading.
    - Changed default `cc45.zeroPageAvail` to `9`.
- **Assembler (ca45)**:
    - Renamed legacy `ldw .ax` syntax to preferred `ldax` mnemonic.

### Optimized
- **Compiler (cc45)**:
    - **Strength Reduction**: Converts multiplication by a power of 2 into equivalent bit shifts (`ASL`, `LSR`), and modulus by a power of 2 into bitwise AND (`AND`).
    - **Constant Propagation**: Substitutes variables with known constant literal values into expressions, enabling further compile-time folding.
    - **Dead Variable Elimination**: Removes stack allocation and initialization for non-volatile local variables that are initialized with constants and not subsequently used.
    - **Constant Initialization**: Uses native `phw #value` for declaring local variables with constant initializers, saving 3 instructions and 3 bytes per declaration.
    - **Constant Assignment**: Optimized 16-bit constant assignments to stack variables to use a "lda twice" sequence, avoiding clobbering the `x` register and reducing code size.
    - **Zero Optimization**: Integrated `zero a, x` simulated opcode for more efficient handling of zero literals.
    - **Surgical Loading**: Improved `VariableReference` loading to surgically update only the required registers if part of the word is already in the correct state.
- **Assembler (ca45)**:
    - **Stack-relative Logic**: Extended `stz`, `stx`, and `sty` with `tsx` absolute indexed addressing simulations where native stack-relative variants are missing.
    - **Word Load Tracking**: Enhanced the optimizer to track register states across high-level word load/store operations.
